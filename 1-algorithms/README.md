# Average
- Write an algorithm that takes an array of floats and calculates the average of its values.
- Add Unit Tests.

# Fibonacci
- Implement the Fibonacci Algorithm recursively
- Measure the time it takes to calculate Fibonacci Number 40
  - You can use `System.Stopwatch` (C#)
  - Or `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` (C++)
- Implement the Fibonacci Algorithm Iteratively
- Measure the time again
