# Selection Sort
- Create a `public static class TurboSort` within `TurboCollections`-Library-Project
  - Add a `public static void SelectionSort(List<int>)`-Method that sorts the List's elements using SelectionSort.
  - In C++, that'd be: `static void(std::vector<int>)`
- Write Unit Tests in `TurboCollections.Test` Unit Test Project.
  - Add a new Test File named `SelectionSortTests`
